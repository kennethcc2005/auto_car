Will update this readme shortly.
The rc car is controled by one raspberry pi 3 with steering and forward/backward (total 2) motors.
The raspberry pi is connected to personal computer for sending out pi carmera images and receiving commands from the computer.
The computer controlling the raspberry pi is trained by ANN and sending out 10 commands in every second.
With pretrained road track style, the rc car can drive flawlessly.
